## 💡 Introduction

### Why?

We want a workflow and a project structure to make us produtive and make the stakeholders happy. We know we'll make mistakes. Let us make them cheaply.

### What is D-Jà Vue?

D-Jà Vue is a **project template** that will create a folder and files structure that contains two projects, a **Django API backend** and a **VueJS + Vuetify frontend**. It can be a great jumpstarting to your next project, Proof of Concept or product idea. It's  production-ready where you can focus on the features, core business and generate value. 

### How?

By answering some questions, you can give the project name and choose things such as the database version, the main model for your project and few other things, then a complete project structure will be created 📂! Then it's possible to start the main feature for your business on the Day one.

### Some principles

- Start by building a backend-less frontend
- Start with the output and test the hypothesis
- Deploy early, deploy often
- TDD is the fastest way

## 🛠️ D-Jà Vue template requirements

To use the Djavue **to create** your project, you'll need only:
- 🐍 Python +3.10
- 🍪 Cookiecutter +1.7

To **Run** everything (the project created), you can choose to two ways 🍨:
- Using Docker 🐋: **Docker** and **Docker compose**
- Without Docker 📦: **Python** for the backend and **Node JS** for the frontend


## 📦 Creating my first project using D-Jà Vue

First, get [cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter/). It's awesome:

```
pip install "cookiecutter>=1.7.0"
```

::: tip
🌈 TIPS/TRICKS: You can use [pipx ](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/) to install cookiecutter globally or creating a pyenv env and set the envs orders and avoiding installing directly in your machine without environments.
:::

Now run it against the D-Jà Vue repositoty. You'll be prompted for some values. Provide them based on your needs!

::: info
👉 Mainly if you are not using Docker and want to use the same Python you have in your machine, use `python -V` to get your current python version. You also can do the same thing for the the NodeJS version `node --version`.
:::

```
cookiecutter https://github.com/evolutio/djavue3
```

Answer the prompts with your own desired flavours. For example:

```shell

What's next?
  cd twitterclone
  👉 For DOCKER users 🐳
       docker compose build
       docker compose up
       go to http://localhost  (PORT is NOT necessary)
  👉 Using virtualenv 📦
       create a virtualenv
       install dependencies
 
  📄 for more information
       https://djavue3.vercel.app

```

**DONE!! 🎉🎉** Your first project structure is created! You can open the folder `twitterclone` and check it out!

**What's next?** The next step is to run it locally and make sure everything is working! Then you can start working on the next important feature to your product or idea!✨

Basically, there are two ways to RUN your project, for the above project we answered to **RUN (initially) WITHOUT DOCKER**, however, by changing the environment variables (.env file) we can change it any time to **RUN USING DOCKER** 🐋

Keep reading to understand the difference!

::: warning
⚠️ This is a **"Twitter Clone"** in terms of UI, the architecture and system design is far way what the real twitter contains. This still a simple frontend and backend API CRUD web app.
:::


## 🐋 Run locally using Docker vs not using Docker (containers)

Using containers (docker) it’s a convenient mode where it aims to have all dependencies as it is in production included and zero configuration, it does not install things in the local machine, by installing just one dependency (docker) you can run as much closer as possible as it runs in production by running one command. It's the best way to run everything locally and give a good developer experience.

::: info
Using 🐋 Docker is the way where you can have a project that have many dependencies internally (libs, frameworks and also SO dependencies) and externally for example database, web mail server, queue manager etc and RUN everything with ONE CLICK. It's quite common developers work on multiple projects, which one uses different Python and Database versions, by managing those matrix of possible each time you swap a project could be a nightmare! The container concept is here to save us!
:::

![local-env-with-docker](./images/local-env-using-docker.jpg)

Using the D-Jà Vue template, your project will have the container concept from the Day 1, whether you will start without it or not, being ready to run it with docker is a good thing, mainly to make the devops better (a.k.a deploy to production)

📦 **Running without docker** can be pretty handy too, it can be much easier to debug, however, it’s necessary to create a virtual environment, install all dependencies in both the backend and frontend projects and have few extra configurations to make the frontend access the backend (CORS settings). It will depend on the developer using tools such as NVM and Pyenv in order to make the local machine be in the same node and python version as the production will.

![local-env-without-docker](./images/local-env-without-docker.jpg)

The good thing is that D-Jà Vue template is using a good foundation to make the developer experience as better as possible whether choosing non friction environment with no docker at all, for example, running a SQLite database locally and any python version available or mixing by running just the postgres database inside a container and of course, being as close as possible from what will run in production, for example, having the web server or any other external service that the project might integrate with.

## 📦 Running the 🦄 backend without docker

**Requirements:**
- Git
- Python +3.9  (for the backend)
- Node JS +14 (for the frontend - in the next step)
- A shell (it can be a linux terminal, a WSL Terminal on Windows or a PowerShell), ⚠️ PowerShell might have few differences in the commands

::: tip
You can use any Python version, however, in an ideal world it's better using locally the same Python version that will be used on Production. That's why you were prompt to choosed one. It's possible to check the prod version (and change it when necessary) by openning the `Dockerfile`.

::: code-group

```dockerfile [Dockerfile]
FROM python:3.10-slim
...

```

🌈 TIPS/TRICKS: You can install a specific Python version into your machine or use tools like [Pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) or [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) to install/handle multiple versions for each project your might work
:::

Let's use the **twitterclone** project created in the former step, it's necessary enter inside the project root folder

```shell
cd twitterclone/
```

Then let's create a python virtual environment for the backend and install the dependencies:

::: warning
⚠️ Don't forget to activate the environment (`source .venv/bin/activate`), by not doing it, the dependencies will be installed inside your machine rather than inside the virtualenv.
:::

```shell
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

The Python environment is ready, you can use `pip freeze` and check all python dependencies installed. One good thing to do in this moment is to run the code style formatter which guarantee all the code are correct.

```shell
black twitterclone/
```
::: info
👉 Remember the name `twitterclone/` can be different based on the answer you gave for the project name
:::

Now, it's time to run the migrations, in other words, create the initial tables (based on the models) inside the database. Basically the models that Django has, such us, **Users** and **Sessions** and also the initial model for our project, in our case the **Tweets** table. The `migrate` django command will read all existing migrations and create the related tables.

::: info
For this project, the default database is SQLite due to we answered `yes` and `2` for the following prompts:
```shell{2,6}
  ...
  [14/27] use_sqlite_local_env (no): yes
  ...
  [21/27] Select docker_usage
    1 - 🐳 use docker by default
    2 - 📦 use venv npm by default
    Choose from [1/2] (1): 2
  ...
```
👉 If you need to change it to Postgres, don't forget you DON'T need to recreate the project again, you'll just need to change the `.env`file
:::

Run the migrations for all django apps:

```shell
./manage.py migrate
```

As soon as we have our database created, let's create a new user:

```shell
./manage.py createsuperuser
Usuário: admin
Endereço de email: admin@example.br
Password: **********
Password (again): **********
Superuser created successfully.
```

Finally we can run the project locally:

```shell
./manage.py runserver
Watching for file changes with StatReloader
Performing system checks...

System check identified no issues (0 silenced).
October 17, 2023 - 08:39:10
Django version 4.1.7, using settings 'dashboardtarget.dashboardtarget.settings'
Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
Quit the server with CONTROL-C.
```

👉 Open your browser and access the `http://localhost:8000`, the application should be running

![local-env-without-docker-localhost-8000](./images/local-run-without-docker-localhost-8000.jpg)

**Other things that you can do at this point:**
- Access the `http://localhost:8000/admin` and after the login (using the user we created before) play with the Django Admin
- Run the command `pytest` and run all the backend tests
- Run the command `./manage.py shell_plus --ipython --print-sql` and run code such as `Tweet.objects.all()` and `Tweet.objects.create(description="My first post using djavue")`
::: info
👉 Remember the name `Tweet` in the code `Tweet.objects.all()` is the model name you answered and might be different for your case.
:::
- Access the `http://localhost:8000/api/docs` and check the API Documentation out
- Access the `http://localhost:8000/api/posts/tweets/list` and get the list of tweets using the backend api
::: info
👉 Again, the `posts` and `tweets` can be different based on your answers from app_name and model_name.
:::
::: info
👉 If you got the response: `{"detail": "Unauthorized"}` for the `http://localhost:8000/api/posts/tweets/list`, you can access
   `http://localhost:8000/admin/login/` and login using the user you created using the command `createsuperuser` and try it again.
:::


## 📦 Running the ⚡️ frontend without docker

**Requirements:**
- Git
- Node JS +14 (for the frontend)
- A shell (it can be a linux terminal, a WSL Terminal on Windows or a PowerShell), ⚠️ PowerShell might have few differences in the commands
- The backend up running

Open a second terminal (the first one should be running the backend). Navigate inside the project folder root and then inside the frontend folder.

```shell
cd twitterclone/frontend/
```

Use the npm to install all the frontend project dependencies. Note that those dependencies are listed inside the `package.json` file. Note also that the "environment" for this project, like the .venv folder created that stored all the dependencies for the backend, for frontend projects, this folder is `node_modules` and we don't need to create or inform anything. By default this folder will be created after running the following command.

```shell
npm install 
```

Now let’s run the frontend using vite

```shell
npm run dev
  VITE v4.4.11  ready in 669 ms
  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:3000/
  ➜  Network: use --host to expose
  ➜  press h to show help

```

**DONE!! 🎉🎉** The frontend is running

👉 Open your browser and access the `http://localhost:3000` (or your machine IP + the port if with the --host) to request the frontend application! It should be running now!

![local-env-without-docker-localhost-3000](./images/local-run-without-docker-localhost-3000.jpg)

::: info
📱 The D-Jà Vue template aims to be mobile first.
:::

::: tip
🌈 TIPS/TRICKS: Alternatively we can use the command `npm run dev -- --host` which will make the application available for your network, in this way you can use your machine IP address and access it from any other machine or mobile within the same WIFI network.
:::

::: tip
You can use any Node JS version, however, in a ideal world it better using locally the same Node JS version that will be used on Production. That's why you were prompt ans choosed one version. It's possible to check the prod version (and change it if necessary) by openning the `frontend/Dockerfile`.

::: code-group

```dockerfile [frontend/Dockerfile]
FROM node:16.17-slim
...

```

🌈 TIPS/TRICKS: You can install a specific node version into your machine or use tools like [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), [nodist](https://github.com/nullivex/nodist) and [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) to install/handle multiple versions for each project use one specific version
:::

**Other things that you can do at this point:**
- Use `npm run format` to run the code formatter (Prettier) and fix some possible formating style problems
- Use `npm run lint` to run the linter and check if some code is not following the rules
- Use `npm run test:unit` to run the frontend tests
- Use `npm run build` which will generate the `dist` folder that contains the final html+css+js to published

## 🐋 Running all with docker

**Requirements:**

- Docker version >= 24.0.2 (in any S.O. you have)
- Docker Compose version >= v2.18.1
- A shell (it can be a linux terminal, a WSL Terminal on Windows or a PowerShell), ⚠️ PowerShell might have few differences in the commands

The way the application behaves in runtime is based on the settings for a given environment and following the [12 factors](https://12factor.net/), in this way, it can connect to a sqllite db or a postgres, it can be in a debug mode or not. Everything can be changed just by changing one or more environment variables without changing any code.
The file that keeps all variables and can be changed is the `.env` file 

To change from running locally using virtual environment (as we saw before and what was answered in the template prompt) to run everything in containers (docker), we must change some values inside the .env

::: code-group

```shell{13-17} [.env (📦 for virtualenv)]

## 🐳 Para uso via container/Docker
POSTGRES_HOST=postgres
POSTGRES_PORT=5432
DATABASE_URL=postgres://posts:posts@postgres:5432/db_posts
```
:::

::: info
👉 For an existing project, we can change the `.env` OR for a new template, we can answer as below:
```shell{2,5} 
  ...
  [14/27] use_sqlite_local_env (no): no
  ...
  [21/27] Select docker_usage
    1 - 🐳 use docker by default
    2 - 📦 use venv npm by default
    Choose from [1/2] (1): 1
  ...
```
:::

First, independently which directory you are, type the following command to make sure there is no container running

```shell
docker ps

CONTAINER ID   IMAGE  COMMAND      CREATED       STATUS                PORTS 
``` 

::: info
👉 If you have something running, you'll need to stop everything by using the command `docker stop [CONTAINER ID]`
:::

Then make sure you are inside the project root

```shell
cd twitterclone/
```

If you already run locally the frontend project, probably there are the `node_modules` folder which was created when you installed the dependencies. So you'll need to delete it

```shell
rm -rf frontend/node_modules
```

Enter the following command to build and run everything:

```shell
docker compose up -d
```

After downloading the image layers and building everything, by running again the command `docker ps`, it should list four containers up running:

```shell
docker ps

CONTAINER ID  IMAGE COMMAND                 STATUS         PORTS        NAMES
1851a43bd     nginx "/docker..."            Up 10 minutes  80->7999     dashboardbeta-nginx-1
e5c00ed78     back-dashboard "bash -..."    Up 10 minutes  8000->8000   dashboardbeta-backend-1
078029b2b     front-dashboard "docker..."   Up 10 minutes  3000->3000   dashboardbeta-frontend-1
3f0949de3     postgres:13.3 "docker..."     Up 10 minutes  15432->5432  dashboardbeta-postgres-1
```

Those container are running because they are described inside the `docker-compose.yaml` file as below

::: code-group

```YAML{3,16,26,35} [docker-compose.yaml]
services:

  backend:
    image: back-twitterclone

    ports:
      - 80:7999
    volumes:
      - ./docker/nginx/default_local:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf

```
:::


**DONE!! 🎉🎉** The containers are ready to use

👉 Open your browser and access frontend at `http://localhost`, remember we do have a web server in front of the frontend, so if you access `http://localhost:3000` instead of `http://localhost` it will show the page, however, it WONT WORK as expected.

::: warning

- ✅ Use `http://localhost`
- ⛔ Don't use `http://localhost:3000`

:::


You also can access the **backend container** and create a user as we did without docker. So open a terminal inside the backend container by the following command:

```shell
docker compose exec -it backend bash
```

Once inside the container, use the normal django commands, for example the create super user:

```shell
root@back-dashboardtarget:/app# ./manage.py createsuperuser
Usuário: admin
Endereço de email: admin@example.com
Password: **********
Password (again): **********
Superuser created successfully.
```

Use `CTRL+D` or type `exit`to finish the terminal and go back to host terminal

**Other things that you can do at this point:**
- Use `docker compose exec -it [container-name] [command]` and execute any command inside any container (backend|postgres|frontend|nginx)
- Use `docker compose down` to stop all containers
- Use `docker compose logs -f [container-name]`to check out the output from one of the containers. Note: if one of the containers didn't run, it's possible to use this command and see the error/cause the container didn't get up.

## 📦 Package Management with Poetry

**Requirements:**
- Check the requirements for the chapter [📦 Creating my first project using D-Jà Vue](#📦-creating-my-first-project-using-d-ja-vue)
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) installed

Let's recreate the **twitterclone** like it was done in the [📦 Creating my first project using D-Jà Vue](#📦-creating-my-first-project-using-d-ja-vue) but now choosing [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)

::: info
👉 This step has less details due to the links above has more information.
:::

Run the cookiecutter command against the D-Jà Vue repositoty. You'll be prompted for some values. Provide them based on your needs and choose **'Poetry'** for the **'package_manager'**:

```
cookiecutter https://github.com/evolutio/djavue3
```

Answer the prompts with your own desired flavours. For example:

```shell
❯ cookiecutter https://github.com/evolutio/djavue3
  [1/27] project_name (My Todo List): Twitter Clone
  [2/27] project_slug (twitterclone):
  [3/27] description (The Ultimate Django and Vue Template): My first Djavue template using Poetry
  [4/27] app_name (core): posts
  [5/27] model (Tasks): Tweets
  [6/27] model_lower (tweets):
...
  [10/27] Select package_manager
    1 - requirements.txt
    2 - pip-tools
    3 - poetry
    Choose from [1/2/3] (1): 3          👈
...
  [14/27] use_sqlite_local_env (no): yes
...
  [21/27] Select docker_usage
    1 - 🐳 use docker by default
    2 - 📦 use venv npm by default      👈
    Choose from [1/2] (1): 2
...
 [SUCCESS]: 🐍 Your Django API backend is created! (root) ✨ 🍰 ✨
 [SUCCESS]: 🍰 Your Vue 3 frontend is created! (frontend folder) ✨ 🍰 ✨
...
```

**DONE!! 🎉🎉** The project structure is created! You can open the folder `twitterclone` and check it out!

```shell
cd twitterclone/
```

Then let's tell Poetry to create the virtual environment inside de project:

```shell
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
```

Then install de project dependencies using Poetry:

```shell
poetry install
```

::: info
👉 Differently from virtualenv, Poetry will create and install the dependencies inside the virtual environment whitout it being active.
:::

To run the backend, it will be necessary to active the environment using the following command:

```shell
poetry shell
```

Now the environment is ready and it's possible to execute the migrations and the run server. Check more details following the steps over the chapter [📦 Creating my first project using D-Jà Vue](#📦-creating-my-first-project-using-d-ja-vue)

**Other things that you can do at this point:**
- Use `poetry env info`, `poetry env info -p` and `poetry env list` to check more details about the virtual environment created by Poetry
- Use `poetry add [some-python-lib]` to install and add it to the `pyproject.toml`
- Use `deactivate` to exit the poetry environment activated by the `poetry shell`
- Use `poetry run flake8` to run something without activating the environment
- Use `poetry show --tree` to show the dependencies and its internal dependencies too
